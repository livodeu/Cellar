Cellar is a download manager.
It is meant to intercept most data that is shared between apps on an Android device and to store that data in a file.
Supports HTTP(S), FTP, SFTP protocols as well as local files.
Cellar supports streaming video (except live video) and it can download videos hosted by certain sites, too.

Cellar needs Android 5 or newer to run.

It is not meant to be run (= it has not been tested) on devices other than phones or tablets.
