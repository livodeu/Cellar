                    {pref_network_allow_metered}
                    <p>Controls whether {app_name} is allowed to use network connections that are tagged as metered. Whether a connection is con&shy;sidered to be metered
                    is deter&shy;mined at the dis&shy;cretion of the operating system. These are usually mobile data connections, like LTE.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_proxy_type}
                    <p>Allows the selection of a proxy type (HTTP or SOCKS). Wikipedia has infor&shy;mation about what a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">proxy</a> is.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_proxy}
                    <p>This setting is visible only if a proxy type has been se&shy;lected. Enter the proxy address and, optionally, a port number here.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_proxy_restrict}
                    <p>This setting is visible only if a proxy type has been selected. The proxy server can be re&shy;stricted to be used for certain hosts only.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_via_vpn}
                    <p>Determines whether {app_name} should use VPN connections.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_blacklist}
                    <p>Set a black&shy;list provider, comparable to a browser's fil&shy;ter list. The app will not load any file from a host given on that list.
                    The list will be up&shy;dated every {blacklist_update} hours, if possible.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_night}
                    <p>The app may either follow the system settings, or toggle the dark mode at specified hours of day. This is meant for older devices that do not support
                    dark mode natively (Android up to version 9). If the device is in battery saver mode, it is possible that the dark mode does not change correctly.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_clipspy}
                    <p>This setting is avail&shy;able only up to Android 9. The app can ob&shy;serve the system clip&shy;board to detect URLs that point to down&shy;loadable resources.
                    This is not possible any more from Android 10 on.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_backup_restore}
                    <p>The downloaded files can be com&shy;pressed into a zip file. You must select a target app to receive the zip file because apps, in&shy;cluding this one, are not allowed to access
                    most parts of the file system, such as the down&shy;loads folder. If you enter a pass&shy;word, the zip file contents will be encrypted.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {action_systemsettings_app}
                    <p>Have a look at the system settings for {app_name}.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_licenses}
                    <p>See the third-party libraries used by {app_name}.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    {pref_share_this}
                    <p>Export {app_name} as an apk file that can be in&shy;stalled on other devices. Note that the exported app will not run on every Android device.
                    If your device is fairly new, the app will probably not run on a very old device.
                    {app_name} has also not been designed to run on devices other than phones or tablets.</p>
